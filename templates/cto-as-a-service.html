			<h2>Common Questions About CTO as a Service</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>"How is this different from hiring a technical consultant?"</h4>
					<p>Consultants typically focus on specific projects or problems. As your fractional CTO, we become part of your leadership team, thinking strategically about your entire technology landscape and business goals.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>"What if we already have a lead developer or technical manager?"</h4>
					<p>Perfect! We often work with existing technical teams, providing the senior leadership and strategic thinking that lets your current team focus on execution. We're here to elevate everyone, not replace anyone.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>"Do you actually write code or just give advice?"</h4>
					<p>While we can dive into code when needed, our primary value is strategic thinking, architecture planning, and technical leadership. We help you build the right things the right way, rather than just building faster.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>"How do you handle AI strategy without getting caught up in the hype?"</h4>
					<p>We're technology pragmatists. We help you identify where AI genuinely adds business value and where simpler solutions make more sense. No AI for AI's sake.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>"What if our technical needs change rapidly?"</h4>
					<p>That's exactly why fractional CTO services work so well for growing companies. We can scale our involvement up or down based on your current challenges and opportunities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>"How quickly can you make an impact?"</h4>
					<p>We typically start with a technical assessment and quick wins in the first 30 days, while building your longer-term technology strategy in parallel.</p>
